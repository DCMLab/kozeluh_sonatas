============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 31, '3/4', 'viio') ms3.Parse.kozeluh_sonatas.29op30no2a
	The label 'viio' in m. 31, onset 3/4 (MC 31, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.V, it expresses the scale degrees
	('7', '2', '4') [('C#', 'E', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 49, '0', 'viio') ms3.Parse.kozeluh_sonatas.29op30no2a
	The label 'viio' in m. 49, onset 0 (MC 49, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 184, '3/4', 'V+') ms3.Parse.kozeluh_sonatas.29op30no2a
	The label 'V+' in m. 184, onset 3/4 (MC 184, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of G.I, it expresses the scale degrees
