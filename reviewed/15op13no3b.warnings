Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.kozeluh_sonatas.15op13no3b
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 6, '5/8', 'V65/IV') ms3.Parse.kozeluh_sonatas.15op13no3b
	The label 'V65/IV' in m. 5, onset 5/8 (MC 6, onset 5/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of E.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('3', '5', 'b7', '1') [('G#', 'B', 'D', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.625 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
